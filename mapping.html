<h2>Travelling in Depression</h2>
<p>When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought me to their<br> home in
France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has given me a unique<br> learning experience</p>
<p>At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the heart of Piazza<br> San Marco
feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas. At thirteen,<br> I saw the ancient,
megalithic structure of Stonehenge and walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that<br> the thousand-year-old stones were still in place. </p>
<p>It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became interested in language.</p>

<p style="margin-left:170px;"> It began with French, which taught me the importance of pronunciation. I remember<br> once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I<br> pronounced it PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on the A,<br> she looked at me bewildered.   </p>
<p style="margin-left:170px;" > In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and aware of its similarities<br> with English through cognates. Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol,<br> which looks different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to me as<br> it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that<br> cognates come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish. </p>
<p style="margin-left:170px;">Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese<br> at my school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character,<br> the meaning is lost. I loved how long words were formed by combining simpler<br> characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be<br> joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means volcano. </p>
<p> spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them.
