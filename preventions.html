</section>
<p class="pp">Follow the guidelines to help protect yourself from contracting and transmitting SARS-CoV-2</p>

    <p class="ol"><b>1. Wash your hands frequently and carefully</b></li>
    

<p>Use warm water and soap and rub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Work the lather to your wrists,<br>
    between your fingers, and under your fingernails. You can also use an antibacterial and antiviral soap.</p>

<p>Use hand sanitizer when you cannot wash your hands properly. Rewash your hands several times a day,<br>
    especially after touching anything, including your phone or laptop.</p>

    
        <p class="ol"><b>2. Avoid touching your face</b></p>

        <p>SARS-CoV-2 can live on some surfaces for up to 72 hours. You can get the virus on your hands if you<br>
touch a surface like:
<ul type="Circle">
    <li>gas pump handle</li>
        <li>your cell phone</li>
        <li>a doorknob</li>
</ul>
Avoid touching any part of your face or head, including your mouth, nose, and eyes. Also avoid biting<br>
    your fingernails. This can give SARS-CoV-2 a chance to go from your hands into your body.
</p>

<p class="ol"><b>3. Stop shaking hands and hugging people — for now</b>
    <p>Similarly, avoid touching other people. Skin-to-skin contact can transmit SARS-CoV-2 from one person<br>
    to another.</p>
</p>

<p class="ol"><b>4. Don’t share personal items</b></p>
<p>Do not share personal items like:

<ul type="disc">
    <li>phones</li>
        <li>makeup</li>
        <li>combs</li>
</ul>
It’s also important not to share eating utensils and straws. Teach children to recognize their reusable<br>
cup, straw, and other dishes for their own use only.
</p>
       


<p class="ol"><b>5. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough and sneeze</b></p>

<p>SARS-CoV-2 is found in high amounts in the nose and mouth. This means it can be carried by air<br>
    droplets to other people when you cough, sneeze, or talk. It can also land on hard surfaces and stay there<br>
    for up to 3 days.</p>
    <p>Use a tissue or sneeze into your elbow to keep your hands as clean as possible. Wash your hands<br>
        carefully after you sneeze or cough, regardless.</p>

        <p class="ol"><b>6. Clean and disinfect surfaces</b></p>

        <p>Use alcohol-based disinfectants to clean hard surfaces in your home like:

            <ul type="square">

                <li>countertops</li>
                    <li>door handles</li>
                    <li>furniture</li>
                    <li>toys</li>
            </ul>
            Also, clean your phone, laptop, and anything else you use regularly several times a day<br>
            <br>
            Disinfect areas after you bring groceries or packages into your home.<br>
            <br>
            Use white vinegar or hydrogen peroxide solutions for general cleaning in between disinfecting surfaces.
        </p>

        <p class="ol"><b>7. Take physical (social) distancing seriously</b></p>

        <p>If you’re carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it’ll be found in high amounts in your spit (sputum). This can<br>
        happen even if you don’t have symptoms.
        <br>
        <br>
        Physical (social) distancing, also means staying home and working remotely when possible.
        <br>
        <br>
If you must go out for necessities, keep a distance of 6 feet (2 m) from other people. You can transmit<br>
the virus by speaking to someone in close contact to you.
    </p>

    <p class="ol"><b>8. Do not gather in groups</b></p>

    <p>Being in a group or gathering makes it more likely that you’ll be in close contact with someone.
        <br>
        <br>
        This includes avoiding all religious places of worship, as you may have to sit or stand too close to<br>
        another congregant. It also includes not congregating at parks or beaches.
        </p>

        <p class="ol"><b>9. Avoid eating or drinking in public places</b></p>

        <p>Now is not the time to go out to eat. This means avoiding restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and other<br>
            eateries.
            <br>
            <br>
            The virus can be transmitted through food, utensils, dishes, and cups. It may also be temporarily<br>
            airborne from other people in the venue.
            <br>
            <br>
            You can still get delivery or takeaway food. Choose foods that are thoroughly cooked and can be<br>
            reheated.
            <br>
            <br>
            High heat (at least 132°F/56°C, according to one recent, not-yet-peer-reviewed lab study) helps to kill<br>
            coronaviruses.
            <br>
            <br>
            This means it may be best to avoid cold foods from restaurants and all food from buffets and open salad<br>
            bars.</p>

            <p class="ol"><b>10. Wash fresh groceries</b></p>

            <p>Wash all produce under running water before eating or preparing.
                <br>
                <br>
                The CDC Trusted Source and the FDA Trusted Source do not recommend using soap, detergent, or<br>
                commercial produce wash on things like fruits and vegetables. Be sure to wash hands before and after<br>
                handling these items.</p>

                <p class="ol"><b>11. Wear a (homemade) mask</b></p>

                <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends Trusted Source that almost<br>
everyone wears a cloth face mask in public settings where physical distancing may be difficult, such as<br>
grocery stores.
<br>
<br>
When used correctly, these masks can help prevent people who are asymptomatic or undiagnosed from<br>
transmitting SARS-CoV-2 when they breathe, talk, sneeze, or cough. This, in turn, slows the<br>
transmission of the virus.
<br>
<br>
The CDC’s website provides instructions Trusted Source for making your own mask at home, using<br>
basic materials such as a T-shirt and scissors.
<br>
<br>
Some pointers to keep in mind:
<ul type="Circle">
    <li>Wearing a mask alone will not prevent you from getting a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Careful hand<br>
        washing and physical distancing must also be followed.</li>
    <li>Cloth masks aren’t as effective as other types of masks, such as surgical masks or N95<br>
        respirators. However, these other masks should be reserved for healthcare workers and first<br>
        responders</li>.
    <li>Wash your hands before you put on your mask.</li>
    <li>Wash your mask after each use.</li>
    <li>You can transfer the virus from your hands to the mask. If you’re wearing a mask, avoid<br>
        touching the front of it.</li>
    <li>You can also transfer the virus from the mask to your hands. Wash your hands if you touch the<br>
        front of the mask.</li>
    <li>A mask shouldn’t be worn by a child under 2 years old, a person who has trouble breathing, or a<br>
        person who can’t remove the mask on their own.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="ol"><b>12. Self-quarantine if sick</b></p>

<p>Call your doctor if you have any symptoms. Stay home until you recover. Avoid sitting, sleeping, or<br>
    eating with your loved ones even if you live in the same home.
    <br>
    <br>
    Wear a mask and wash your hands as much as possible. If you need urgent medical care, wear a mask<br>
    and let them know you may have COVID-19.</p>
