 <h3 class="hh3">Mission</h3>
 <p>Our mission is to serve individuals at risk for COVID-19 and food insecurity, using technology to<br>
    empower community organizations and local volunteers to deliver the essential supplies to those in<br>
    need.</p>
    <h3 class="hh3">How we help</h3>
    <p>Lemme Help connects those who must shelter in place with our volunteers and delivery partners so<br>
        groceries, medication and essential supplies get delivered safely. Our technology platform makes<br>
        <img src="man.png" alt="Man with poster" class="iiimg">
        community volunteerism easy and reliable while providing an intuitive<br>
        solution for partners to scale their own impact.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our partner solutions allow organizations to fulfill custom and batch<br>
        requests at scale through the Lemme Help platform, while we connect<br>
        individuals who need help and can offer help through our website.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our partnerships with organizations like Wider Circle, Optum, Second<br>
        Harvest, Uber and others have allowed us to help bridge volunteer<br>
        shortages and solve the challenge of last mile delivery at scale. We've<br>
        grown the number of people we can help by working together—and we<br>
        are always open to new partners who want to contribute to our mission.</p>

        <h3 class="hh3">Join our team</h3>
        <p>Founded by veterans of Uber, Facebook, and Google, as well as students beginning their careers, the<br>
            Lemme Help organization comprises more than 150 volunteers around the country who want to give<br>
            back. Together, we make local volunteerism easy and reliable for our partners and help to slow the<br>
            national spread of COVID-19.<br>
            <br>
            If you are passionate about making a difference in people’s lives, we’d love to have you join our team of<br>
            dedicated volunteers!
