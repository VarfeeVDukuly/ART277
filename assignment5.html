         <p>Helping Hands is a non-profit organization dedicated to serving those most at-risk to COVID-19:<br>
            senior citizens, the immune compromised, and people with pre-existing medical conditions which<br>
            put them at additional risk.<br><br>
            Our community volunteers and delivery partners deliver groceries, medicine, and other necessary<br>
            supplies to empower everyone to stay healthy and be as responsible as they can be.</p>

            <p>Helping Hands Community connects those who must shelter in place with our<br>
                volunteers and delivery partners so groceries, medication and essential<br>
                supplies get delivered safely. Our technology platform makes community<br>
                volunteerism easy and reliable while providing an intuitive solution for<br>
                partners to scale their own impact.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our partner solutions allow organizations to fulfill custom and batch requests<br>
                at scale through the Helping Hands Community platform, while we connect<br>
                individuals who need help and can offer help through our website.</p>
